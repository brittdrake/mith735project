  <p>There are three different types of wireframe designs that I developed for this project.
  Landing Page – Example 1 is designed to provide alternatives for how users navigate the site. Users will be able to see three different components of the project, with summary information about the purpose of the project at the bottom of the home page. While this is an interesting design, because of the iterative and incremental approach of the website design, this will not be effective as there will not be sufficient content to launch the first iteration.</p>

  <p> Landing Page – Example 2 is designed for visual emphasis. When users visit the site, they will first see a compelling graphic that intended to be a visual representation of the research project. This layout is also limiting if users are unable to interpret the image and there is not any textual description of the site.  Furthermore, I am concerned that users may have difficulty navigating this particular layout.</p>

  <p> Landing Page – Example 3 is the most effective for this design. As it quickly displays all of the relevant information that a user needs to know about the website. The basic architecture can be quickly deployed for any iteration of the site.  It does not require users or co-researchers to navigate to other pages to begin contributing content for the first two iterations of the project. </p>
