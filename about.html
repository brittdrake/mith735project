  <p> As a life-long resident of Prince George’s County, Maryland, I claim go-go music as an important element of my upbringing and social experiences as an adult. As a child, I would listen to songs by Chuck Brown, Rare Essence, or Trouble Funk with my older relatives at for celebratory occasions – like a family cookout or family reunion or during mundane activities such as commuting for school. Multiple family members and close friends performed in go-go bands. When I relocated for college, I began participating in digital communities that were centered around the community. After returning from school, I started to observe that many of the go-go clubs that were around when I was a child had closed down – most under pressure from local governments. Seemingly these closures seemed to be connected with simultaneous plans for redevelopment or revitalization in local places and the demolition of residential dwellings. </p>

<p>This project seeks to understand how the geographic locations of private go-go establishments in the Washington have, DC region changed from 1970 – 2020 in relationship to residential migration. </p>
