<p> TEI, also known as Text Encoding Iniaitive, is a process to visualize text in the digital arena. It allows users to identify important features and attributes(people, places, music, people's roles) and categorize them using special font styles. </p>

<p>For this project, I chose to complete a TEI analysis of Anwan Glover's reccomendation and approval to participate as a member of Washington, DC Mayor Bowser's Commission on Nightlife and Culture. This nomination marks an unique shift in the perception and embrace of go-go music in Washington, DC. At one point, go-go music (and the culture creators) was scapegoated as the reason new development did not happen in the city, now the city embraces the musical genre as a keen and important aspect for cultural activity and vibrancy. Read Sarah Freeman-Woolperts' article <a href="https://wagingnonviolence.org/2019/09/dontmutedc-washington-go-go-music-gentrification-cultural-erasure/"> Washington DC natives fight displacement and cultural erasure to the beat of go-go music </a> to learn more. </p>
