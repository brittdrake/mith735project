<p><b> Research Question:</b> <i> How have the geographic locations of private go-go establishments in the Washington, DC region changed from 1970 – 2018 in relationship to residential migration?  </i></p>

<p><b>Hypothesis:</b> The migration of private go-go establishments over time is consistent with the migration of the residential population in the neighboring community. Land-use permitting, and code enforcement was used consistently as a mechanism to restrict the locations where privately-owned go-go establishment could operate.</p>

<p><h4>Project Description</h4>
  Go-go music is one of the indigenous sounds of the Washington, DC metro region. Birth out of black working-class and underclass struggles in the mid-1970s to the present, the music is an oral documentation of black life in the United States’ Chocolate City. Fronted by powerful percussions clashes between traditional African-drumming, Pentecostal Praise riffs, electronic synthesizers, audiences and band members engage in calls and responses that identify neighborhoods, social clubs, schools, and ordinary people.  This project seeks to develop a living digital archive to preserve and share the community’s culture.</p>

<p>The immediate goals of this project are to (1) identify and document private social venues where go-go music was performed from 1970 to 2018; (2) compare and track the socio-economic conditions of immediate neighborhood where these venues were located over time; and (3) develop a digital soundscape and story map of go-go music in Washington, DC and neighboring suburbs. It is my hope that through this research, I would be able to observe how gentrification (via policing, political violence) has changed where go-go music could be performed – and ultimately where urban black culture was permitted to exist.</p>

<p>As a life-long resident of Prince George’s County, Maryland, I claim go-go music as an important element of my upbringing and social experiences as an adult. As a child, I would listen to songs by Chuck Brown, Rare Essence, or Trouble Funk with my older relatives at for celebratory occasions – like a family reunion or during mundane activities such as riding to school. Multiple family members and close friends performed in go-go bands. When I relocated for college, I began participating in digital communities that were centered around the community. Today, I still participate in these digital and in-person go-go communities. </p>

<p><h4>Project Purpose and Background</h4>
  Go-go music is a form of black popular music that started in Washington, DC and the neighboring suburb of Prince George’s County, Maryland. Refined and popularized by Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, the music has played consistently in Washington, DC since the 1970s. Like different forms of black popular music that developed post-1968, go-go music was a direct response to the living conditions, unequal opportunity, quality of life and structural oppression that African Americans dealt with living in inner cities and rapidly changing suburban areas.</p>

  <p>In 1997, when Backyard Band, a Washington, DC-based go-go band comprised of African American men in their late teens and mid-20s, got on the microphone and proclaimed “I Don’t Want to Die” African American youth in the city felt it. By that time, nearly a generation of inner-city young Black men had been arrested, killed, or were dealing with the lingering effects of violence in the city. Backyard Band’s song, Unibomber, was a first-hand account from young black men living in a violent city expressing their fears of dying early. The song served as an opportunity to memorialize the lives of homicide victims in the city, while also unifying black youth in the city as an anti-violence protest song.</p>

  <p>The year that Unibomber came out was another year of nearly a murder a day in Washington, DC. From 1990 to 1996, the DC Police Department, reported 2947 homicides – with an additional 301 killed in 1997. The vast majority of the homicide victims being African American teenagers and young adult men (ages 15-34). Victims of gun violence. The song resonated with DC’s black youth – as many had lost friends or loved ones to the violence. When listening to live recording so the song today, you can hear audience members invoking the names of deceased loved-ones and friends and band members reciting the names of the local neighborhoods and stomping grounds.</p>

  <p>As exampled by Backyard Band’s performance of Unibomber, go-go music embodies the oral tradition and recounts the issues of importance to the performers and those who listen to and experience their music.</p>

<p><b>Cultural Heritage and Gentrification:</b>
  The oral tradition, via music, is central to Black American society. In Word! The African American Oral Tradition and its Rhetorical Impact on American Popular Culture, Dr. Janice Hamlet, a scholar in African American rhetoric and communications, situates the oral tradition as “…a fundamental vehicle for cultural expression and survival,” that has “… preserved the cultural heritage and reflected the collective spirit of the race.”<sup>1</sup>  Black popular music, holds a wealth of information about black society, black geographies, and black life. . In the same article Hamlet, further argues that “the musical expressions of African Americans and the Black church have been the most significant forces in maintaining and nurturing the surviving African/African American language and cultural tradition.”<sup>2</sup> </p>

    <p>For this reason, black popular music becomes the historical documentation of the underclass of American Society. Black music in the United States is the counter-narrative to bring importance and value back to the lives of the people who were repeatedly told that their lives did not matter either through the consistent underrepresentation in mainstream society; the misunderstanding of cultural practices; or the exploitation of their bodies and labor.<sup>3</sup> </p>

    <p>As a form of intangible cultural heritage, music lacks materiality requires the social connection and a particular spatial proximity and density of others in the social community to proliferate, replicate, and validate the practice.<sup>4</sup>    However, the use of land-use policies and policing to disperse under-resourced African Americans from compact cities, to more sprawling suburbs threatens the continuation of this practice and ultimately stripping one’s sense of identity as the cultural landscape drastically changes.</p>

    <p>While generally a messy term, gentrification can simply be described as a government-supported initiative that seeks to increase economic value and economic utility in residential neighborhoods that have systematically and historically been deprived government investment, by dispersing the existing inhabitants.<sup>5</sup> </p>

    <p>In addition to causing the displacement of people from physical spaces, gentrification disrupts social connections and inevitably cultural traditions that rely on the social relationships that develop around a particular place. By using a variety of practices including permit denial, policing, and code violations, local governments exacerbate neighborhood displacement and reinforce who has a right to a neighborhood. Furthermore, gentrification does not just impact residents; it also impacts business owners and businesses, particularly those that provide social and recreational spaces for long-time neighboring residents.</p>

  <p>A 2019 report titled <a href="https://ncrc.org/gentrification/"<i>Shifting Neighborhoods: Gentrification and Cultural displacement in American Cities</i></a>, concluded that gentrification in Washington, DC was the most intense out of fifteen major cities in the United States.<sup>6</sup>   Moreover, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, describe the impacts of gentrification on cultural heritage as “…the loss of historically and culturally significant institutions for a community.”</p>

  <p>If black music is the conduit, as Dr. Hamlet describes, for documenting black culture, then the failure to preserve black music and the places where it was performed, either through the lack of recognition, recordation, archival, performance, and interpretation, is an act of erasing the existence of black history and culture. Given the speed at which demographics in the Washington, DC metro region is changing; the age of go-go’s most notable musicians; combined with the long-term community effects of mass incarceration and community violence there is unique urgency to document and preserve the music.</p>

  <h4>Environmental Scan and Literature Review </h4>
  <p>Defining a clear methodology to conduct this project is difficult because of the temporal, political, and spatial conflicts that are inherent in preserving aspects of a cultural tradition that has been described as “oppositional to traditional American values.”<sup>7</sup>   Inequities that stem from race, class, and place in the United States are intersectional and compounding. It is the accumulation of multiple forms of oppression and discrimination that ultimately lead to the early loss of life for African Americans which abruptly truncate the amount of time that communities have to share their cultural practices with future generations.</p>

  <p>Brittany Cooper, author of Eloquent Rage, brilliantly describes this urgency to act in her 2016 TEDtalk on the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brittney_cooper_the_racial_politics_of_time?language=en"<i>Racial Politics of Time</i></a>. Cooper argues that “…[black people’s] have lives are lives of perpetual urgency. Time is used to displace us…”<sup>8</sup> </p>

  <p>Moreover, as a participant in the go-go tradition and researcher seeking to preserve the stories of my social community, I feel the same looming urgency to quickly document and reshare the information that I am able to collect about this topic. Will I be able to reshare my own narrative? Will others tell my story? Will my loved ones and neighborhood idols transition before I can document their stories? Will my cultural landscapes be gentrified before I can save my memories? There are no affordable housing provisions to resettle the walls that cannot talk. Because of this fear, I am skeptical if traditional approaches to developing a digital archive and digital project will be sufficient.</p>

  <p>Understanding this reality as a researcher and a participant of the go-go tradition, requires me to make a decision between finding ways to quickly document and share research findings with impacted community members (as this information can be used to influence policy decisions that are happening and impacting community members now) or undergo a more traditional research timeframe and approach that suits the requirements and expectations of traditional academy and the nonprofit industrial complex.</p>

  <p>Several researchers and community-based practitioners struggled with this dilemma. During the 2011 Occupy Wall-Street protests, movement organizers decided to preserve and archive the social movement. To do this, organizers created a living archive. In its design, the living archive was intended to be permeable, broad reaching, and reflective the movements goals – to rebalance and reduce economic inequities in the United States.  The “Occupy Archives” was to be a revolutionary collection that would transform digital activism and archival practice. However, when outsiders looked in, they perceived the archival product as poorly scoped, unmanageable, and undefined – merely because it did not mirror traditional archival values.</p>

<p>In Assembling the <i>Living Archive: A Media- Archaeological Excavation of Occupy Wall Street</i> Jason Buel describes the purpose of the digital archive as a collection that:</p><br><br/>

<blockquote> “…would be publicly accessible from anywhere, distributed across multiple sites, and constantly growing with the addition of new materials by anyone who felt it to contribute to it. No one would be excluded.”<sup>9</sup></blockquote><br><br/>

<p>However, in its implementation, the platform excluded those that did not have digital access, arguably the people that social movement was intended to serve. In select instances the methodological process for documenting and preserving information, mandated that people participate in the archival process regardless of permission, blurring the lines between public participation and private consent.<sup>10</sup>  Moreover, as the movement lacked an “identified leader” it was challenging to authenticate the validity or purposefulness of different collected objects. Buel directed much critique to the flowed methodological process and the lack of clarity of intent:</p><br><br/>

<blockquote> “In except, of course, for people who did not have access to the technologies needed to participate in the archiving process, who lacked the technical skills needed to produce and digitally archive materials, who did not have sufficient social capital to make meaningful decisions about materials they contributed, or who were simply unaware of the existence of such a decentralized online archive.”<sup>11</sup> </blockquote><br><br/>

<p> Buel’s concluding thoughts on the development appreciates the novelty and boisterousness of the archives to create a digital archive in a manner that was in direct opposition to traditional archival methodology. He further describes the living archive as a regenerative process, calling and responding to itself, while amplifying it purpose at the same time.</p><br><br/>

 <blockquote> “The living archive feeds back into the way the movement itself is understood in the moment it is becoming a movement. This is key: it is not a retrospective archiving process of looking back on a historical event and deciding how to frame it for the future. It is instead the imagining of (and being in) the present as part of the process of creating a living archive.”<sup>12</sup> </blockquote><br><br/>

 <p> To this extent the “living archive” it is effectively a form of embedded planning. </p>

 <p> Embedded Planning is an emerging theoretical framework in Urban Planning that situates urban planners on equal footing as community members. Popularized by Jonathan Pacheco Bell, this approach socially repositions planners, no longer as above community lay people in order to more effectively address socio-spatial issues and remedy social-inequities that are rooted in and perpetuated through spatial design.<sup>13</sup>  Unlike other planning practices, Embedded Planning requires planners to actively participate in the mundane and extraordinary events in the community in which they are serving.  While there has not been much scholarly research on embedded planning practices for the digital humanities, there has been research in the radical planning tradition. Radical Planning is rooted in the social justice camp of urban planning. Like the “living archive” radical planning is an oppositional method for spatial design that challenges normative praxis and epistemological notions of planning.<sup>14,15</sup></p>

 <p>In Toward Cosmopolis, Leonie Sandercock describes the origins of radical planning:</p><br><br/>

 <blockquote> Radical practice emerged from experiences with and a critique of existing unequal relations and distributions of power, opportunity, and resources. The goal of these practices is to work for structural transformation of systematic inequalities and, in the process to empower those who have been systematically disempowered.<sup>16</sup></blockquote><br><br/>

 <p>The creation and practice of place-based cultural traditions, in response to a community’s legal inability to participate in mainstream cultural traditions, because of racial segregation is an act of radical planning. It provides a group of people with who are legally classified as subhuman the ability to self-determine.</p>

 <p> The Black Broadway on U Street is a great example of a digital humanities project that reflects on black cultural practices and social spaces as radical planning. Black Broadway on U Street identifies historic jazz locations in the Historic U Street Corridor of Washington, DC and neighboring places important to the black local economy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Designed as an interactive oral history, the project has multiple media components including creative pop-up performances, augmented reality, and a mobile application, in addition to a website. The website contains a digital map identifying significant community venues and contains oral histories.  While the project provides historical documentation for locations where jazz music was performed in Washington, DC, it lacks a critical analysis of local policies and land-uses practices that restricted African Americans to the U Street corridor. The project also does not provide greater context as what is happening to the spaces today. This cultural, political, spatial, and temporal conflicts are something that I would like to design and embed in my digital project. Furthermore, because the project launched some sixty years following the corridor’s most vibrant time (prior to gentrification) many of the stories have been lost or are difficult to uncover. </p>

<h4>Methodlogical Approach</h4>
  <p>Taking these examples as guidance, I believe it will be most effective to use a methodological framework that relies on frequent public iterations, a communal collaboration and ownership structure, and political critique. For this reason, I intend to integrate practices of radical planning, community-based participatory action research, and an evolutionary lifecycle design approach.<sup>17</sup>  </p>

  <p> Using the community-based participatory action research framework, go-go participants (either observers, performers, managers, or public officials) will serve as the key experts and co-researchers for this project. The radical planning methodologies will serve as a vehicle to critically interrogate government land-use policies and its sociological and cultural impacts and roots.  Finally, to address the urgency of time and the potential loss of cultural knowledge, I propose using an iterative and open research approach that permits the data collection phase of the research to be ongoing and public. I believe it is the most effective and advantageous for this project as it reinforces the communal aspects and essence of the go-go tradition, provides for the consistent evolution of the archive; while providing individuals who are most adversely impacted by the land-use policies. I propose publishing this project in the following phases/iterations:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>Iteration 1: Develop a public facing website to host information related to the digital humanities project and the project’s description.</b> This website serves as one direct digital space where co-researchers (community participants) can access information related to the project.  </li><br><br/>

  <li><b>Iteration 2: Create a living inventory of go-go venues in the DC Metro Area from 1970 to 2020.</b> In this phase, I will use personal knowledge, go-go concert posters from DC Libraries Go-go archives; primary source accounts; newspaper articles; and the digital index/repository located at PaPalace.com to develop a listing of different go-go venues in Washington, DC and Prince George’s County, Maryland. The document will be published to an open-source platform and then embedded on the project’s website. The purpose of this iteration is to provide go-go participants (fans, current and former band members) the opportunity review, authenticate, and edit the listing that was developed, while also sharing, in real-time, research findings. This method adds legitimacy and transparency to the process, because it ensures that participants have agency in sharing their expertise. In this role, the researcher primarily serves as an organizer of community expertise, rather than the sole decider of what is valid or important. While primary emphasis will focus on identifying private venues, the living archive will not exclude information related to publicly held spaces (Community Centers, Public Parks etc), as this information is still important to have in the public domain. This living inventory will also collect information related to the years of operation and the reason for closing (if closed) for the different social venues. <br><br/>

  The final critical element for the inventory is the crowd-sourced “favorite album” from each venue.  This information can be collected easily because go-go is primarily recorded during a live performance. all PA-tapes (go-go recordings) are titled by the name of the band, the date of the concert, and the location of the go-go concert.
  </li><br><br/>

  <li><b>Iteration 3: Conduct a census-tract level geospatial analysis of demographic change overtime (1970s - 2018) in comparison to private go-go venue locations.</b> This exercise is intended to better understand if and how go-go venues moved (social venues) with the movement of the social community that created the music. To conduct this exercise, I will use a combination of Census Tiger Data Files, National Historic GIS Data, and the index of go-go venues created in Iteration 2.  Following this iteration there will be an external release of the digital map. This iteration includes the geolocation of different go-go venues </li><br><br/>
  <li><b>Iteration 4: Launch Soundscape and Story Map.</b> The fourth iteration of the project includes a soundscape map which spatializes all of the attributes from the living inventory into a digital map. When users visit the soundscape map, they will be able to see the private social venues where go-go was performed; and select each venue to get additional information about permitting; reason for closing; and crowd-source song selection.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Resources</h4>
<p> To complete this research there are a variety of different subjects and data materials that I will reference and need to identify, collect, and verify. This is especially important because there are no archival or canonical listing of PA-tapes or go-go venues. This dataset will need to be created by relying on non-traditional sources such as digital communities (Facebook Groups and Online Message Boards) for information and documentation; reviewing newspaper articles; conducting oral history interviews or community questionnaires; reviewing old PA-tapes (go-go recordings); Go-go Posters; and personal knowledge.</p>

<p>Digital Go-go Communities that I intend to work with to build out the archival inventory include the Facebook Groups SGG, and The Go-Go Report. SGG, (formerly Strictly Go-Go DC) is a private digital social group that has approximately 114 members. The Go-Go report is another Facebook Group solely focused on black issues in Washington, DC metro region. There is a total membership includes approximately 30,000 individuals.</p>

<p>Large repositories for go-go music is limited, as most of the music was recorded locally and live. PaPalace.com is an e-store that contains the most comprehensive known listing of go-go music. The e-store database will be helpful for identifying different go-go venues and for developing a broader soundscape. Socio-spatial Data Tiger Shapefiles and other Census data formatted as shapefiles from 1970 to 2018.</p>
