<p><b> Research Question:</b> <i> How has gentrification, specifically political officials use of municipal land-use and permitting authority, caused the displacement go-go performance spaces in the Washington, DC region? </i></p>

<p><b>Alternative Research Question:</b> <i> How have the geographic locations of go-go performance spaces in the Washington, DC region changed from 1970 - 2020?</i></p>

<p>While generally a messy term, gentrification can simply be described as a government-supported initiative that seeks to increase economic value and economic utility in residential neighborhoods that have systematically and historically been deprived government investment. In Race, Class and Politics in the Cappuccino City, a book that explores economic development and gentrification in Washington, DC, Derek Hyra describes two types of gentrification -- typical and atypical. Typical gentrification being defined as young white artists moving into a community and setting the stage for wealthier white professionals and atypical gentrification being where black culture becomes a commodity and is marketed and sold to white professionals as an “authentic urban experience.”</p>

<p>In addition to causing the displacement of people from physical spaces, gentrification also disrupts social connections and inevitably cultural traditions that rely on the social relationships that develop around a particular place. By using a variety of practices including permit denial, policing, and code violations, local governments exacerbate neighborhood displacement and reinforce who has a right to a neighborhood. Furthermore, gentrification does not just impact residents; it also impacts business owners and businesses, particularly those that provide social and recreational spaces for long-time neighboring residents.</p>

<p>A 2019 report titled <a href="https://ncrc.org/gentrification/"<i>Shifting Neighborhoods: Gentrification and Cultural displacement in American Cities</i></a>, concluded that gentrification in Washington, DC was the most intense out of fifteen major cities in the United States. To counter the spatial and cultural displacement from the city, residents turned to go-go, a musical tradition in Washington, DC that is rooted in the African-American experience. The protest campaigns used the musical tradition to bring awareness to the effects of displacement and to advocate for policy measures that help to push for equity in the City. Most importantly go-go shows were held in public and private locations across the city to encourage the preservation and performance of the musical tradition, as many venues had been shut down due to violence and changing neighborhood demographics.</p>

<p>The purpose of this research is to determine how gentrification (via policing and political violence) changed where go-go music was performed.  Specifically through this research, I would like to understand how gentrification, policing, and political violence directed towards the urban black community in Washington, DC metro region, could be understood through identifying where go-go venues were located and when. Furthermore, I hope that this research will allow me to further understand how gentrification, specifically political officials use of municipal land-use and permitting authority, has caused the displacement go-go performance spaces in the Washington, DC region.</p>

<h4>SUBJECTS</h4>
<p>To complete this research there are a variety of different subjects and data materials that I will reference and need to identify. First, I will need to use Tiger Shapefiles and other Census data formatted as shapefiles from 1970 to 2020. I will also need to use projected property layer data and base maps for Washington, DC and  jurisdictions surrounding the city.  These files will be helpful to show the demographic and change overtime. Next, I will need to identify, organize and geolocate, music venues where go-go albums were recorded. Finally, I would like to collect primary and secondary sources about each of the venues, including the opening date and the closing date of the venue. This process would be using newspaper articles, photographs, videos, and audio recordings that can be found for the locations.</p>

<h4>METHODS</h4>
<p>To complete this research, I plan to use a Community Participatory Research Approach. Using this method, community members will be integral in identifying and geolocating current and existing go-go venues in the Washington, DC region. Additionally, a questionnaire will be delivered to identify popular go-go albums that were recorded in the respective go-go venues. A spatial analysis will be conducted using the geolocated addresses combined and Census data to see how the musical venues have migrated overtime. Finally, a content analysis will be conducted to document different government policies that were used to curb the practice of go-go in the region.</p>
